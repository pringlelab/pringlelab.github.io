            <h3><p>Ecology and Evolution of <em>Amanita thiersii</em> and <em>Amanita muscaria</em></p></h3>
            <p><a href="http://pluto.njcc.com/%7Eret/amanita/species/thiersii.html"><em>Amanita thiersii</em></a> is a saprotrophic basidiomycete found in lawns throughout the midwestern United States.
            <a href="http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/muscgues.html"><em>Amanita muscaria</em></a> forms ectomycorrhizal symbioses with plants.&nbsp; Sequencing the genomes of these closely related species will teach us about the different genetic architectures of asymbiotic and symbiotic organisms, and may also help us to develop clean energy technologies.</p>
    
            <p>The Department of Energy explains <a href="http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/athiersii.html">the connection between thiersii and clean energy</a> and the <em>A. thiersii</em> genome is <a href="http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Amath1/Amath1.home.html">now public.</a> DOE Joint Genome Institute also <a href="http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/CSP2011-martin.html">describes research with ectomycorrhizal fungi</a>, including <em>A. muscaria</em>.</p>
    
            <p>If you’re curious to know more about <em>A. thiersii</em> or our research on symbiotic genomes, you may want to read one of our papers:</p>
            <p>Wolfe BE, M Kuo, A Pringle. 2012. <em>Amanita thiersii</em> is a saprotrophic fungus expanding its range in the United States. Mycologia 104:&nbsp;22-33 </p>
            <p>Wolfe BE, RE Tulloss, A Pringle. 2012. The irreversible loss of a decomposition pathway marks the single origin of an ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. PLoS ONE 7(7):&nbsp;e39597. </p>
    
            <h3><p>Collaborate / Send us specimens of <em>A. thiersii</em></p></h3>
    
            <p>If you collect <em>A. thiersii</em> we’d be interested to know about it. We are also hoping to develop additional cultures for the <em>A. thiersii</em> genome project. If you collect fresh mushrooms and are willing to share, please follow these instructions below.</p>
    
            <h3><p>Instructions for Collecting &amp; Shipping <em>Amanita thiersii</em>:</p></h3>
            <p>Collect 3-5 mushrooms. Make sure they have recently emerged and are fresh. Mushrooms that have been heavily rained on or appear to have insects thriving in the gills are not good for culturing.</p>
            <p>We've found that you can ship the mushrooms by carefully placing newspaper and other soft materials around them in a box. Putting large plastic yogurt containers or other containers around individual mushrooms can help keep them from getting crushed.&nbsp; Putting a small frozen ice pack in with the package keeps it cool during shipping.</p>
            <p>Once the mushrooms are packed, please <a href="mailto:ToAnnePringle@gmail.com">email Anne</a> to ask where mushrooms should be shipped.</p>
            <p>If you could take photos of the site and notes about the habitat, that would be helpful as well.</p>
